bitcoin-prices
==============

simple script that gives you the "last" (and change) price on:

MtGox
Coinbase
Bitstamp
Btc-e

You can add any exchange you like by making a folder in exchanges named what
you want the exchange to appear as, and creating the api.sh & price.sh within it


btcp.sh should be run in the background, it grabs and records the bitcoin data
btcp_disp.sh is an example of how to handle the bitcoin data
